            <p>It is a truth universally acknowledged that a person in possession of a good book must be in want of a place to read. And in the immortal words of real estate, sometimes it really is all about location, location, location. Because while we readers may love reading no matter where we are, there are still certain spaces that are conducive to good reading, and they are different for all of us.</p>
            <p>The beach is one of our favorite places to stretch out on a towel, shield our eyes from the sun, and tear through some serious pages. Plus, it does not hurt that this sunny, sandy, well-sunscreened reading locale has the background hum of waves crashing. Utter bliss!</p>
            <p><br>Tea, coffee, pastries, some light pop-rockâ€¦ Your local indie cafe most likely has all of these and more. Some franchises of big chains even have little free libraries that you can peruse if you forgot to bring your tablet, book, or newspaper with you (which, if you are a reader, is farfetched, but it is nice to have options).</p>
            <p>Whether you are on a bus, a train, a subway, an el, a monorail, a streetcar, or an airplane, there is only one concern about reading on public transit: whether or not you suffer from motion sickness. And if you do not, then read, read, read away!</p>
